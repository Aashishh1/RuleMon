<div align='center'> <h1> Traffic Violation Detection SystemðŸš¦</h1> </div>

## <h1>Introduction</h1>

The growing number of vehicles in urban areas has led to increased traffic volumes, making traffic violations a significant concern. These infractions not only cause extensive property damage but also result in accidents that jeopardize lives. To tackle this urgent issue and mitigate such consequences, traffic violation detection systems are crucial. These systems ensure that traffic regulations are enforced consistently and assist in identifying and apprehending offenders.

A real-time traffic violation detection system enables authorities to monitor roads continuously, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of road safety measures. By detecting violations more rapidly than human observers, the system helps traffic enforcers uphold safe road practices with greater accuracy. This system can identify common traffic violations in real-time, including signal violations, parking violations, and wrong-way driving. Furthermore, it features a user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies operation, allowing users to oversee traffic and address rule violations with ease.
